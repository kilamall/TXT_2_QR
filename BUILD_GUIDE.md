### ✅ Option 2: Web App (Already LIVE & FREE!)

Your web app is already working:

**URL:** https://txt-2-qr-expo-final-n3l17uquh-kilams-projects-745ba56f.vercel.app

**Add to iPhone Home Screen (Acts like app!):**

### ✅ Option 3: Expo Go (FREE but Limited)

Remove native modules temporarily:

I can create a version that works in Expo Go by removing:
- AdMob/IAP (add later)
- Some camera features

Then you can test in Expo Go for FREE!

### ❌ Option 4: iOS Native Build

**Requires:**
- Apple Developer account ($99/year)

## 🎯 **Recommended Path:**

### Immediate (FREE):
1. **Use web version** on your iPhone (add to home screen!)
